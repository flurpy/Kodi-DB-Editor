# Kodi-Genre-Tag-Manager

This program, written in Python, will let you set the genre(s) and tag(s) assigned to TV Shows or Movies in your Kodi MySQL database. 

Background: I use genres to categorize TV shows for our household. Shows that we all watch together have a genre of Family. Shows that are only watched by kids have a genre of Kids. Shows that only hold the interest of one person in the family has a genre with their name. This program was written to quickly replace the genre(s) that get scraped/assigned when the show is first added to the library. It can do the same for Movies as well. I also use the tags feature to organize movies that are suitable for the whole family or of interest to only one person. I use tags for movies since I do want to keep the genres in place. I use genres for TV simply because that's what I did from the begining several years ago and my family is used to it.

I'm hoping that the use of this tool is intuitive and I have not yet written up any documentation. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a message.

Tested on:
Kodi 17.3 and 17.4
mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.1.26-MariaDB
