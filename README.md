# Kodi-DB-Editor

This program, written in Python, will let you set the genre(s) assigned to TV Shows or Movies in your Kodi MySQL database. It will also let you add sets to Movies. 

Background: I use genres to categorize TV shows for our household. Shows that we all watch together have a genre of Family. Shows that are only watched by kids have a genre of Kids. Shows that only hold the interest of one person in the family has a genre with their name. This program was writtent to quickly replace the genre(s) that get scraped/assigned when the show is first added to the library. It can do the same for Movies as well. I also use the sets feature to organize movies that are suitable for the whole family so this program also lets you quickly add movies to a set.
